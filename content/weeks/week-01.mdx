This is the beginning. Not the beginning of work or learning or building—those have been happening for a while now. This is the beginning of *writing it down*.

## Why Weekly?

Weekly feels right. Daily is too noisy, monthly too sparse. A week is long enough to accumulate meaningful observations but short enough to remember the details.

The goal isn't to create content. It's to create a record. A trail of breadcrumbs that future-me can follow back when wondering how things were decided, what was tried, and what was learned.

## The Rules

Simple rules for a sustainable practice:

1. **One post per week.** No more, no less. Consistency over volume.
2. **Write for clarity.** Not for audience or SEO. Just clear thinking.
3. **Ship imperfect.** Better published and flawed than perfect and unpublished.
4. **No metrics.** No analytics dashboards to check. No engagement to chase.

## This Week

This week was about setting up infrastructure. The blog itself. Static, simple, boring. Next.js with MDX because that's the stack I know and trust. No database, no CMS, no authentication. Just files.

The technical decisions were intentional:

- **Static generation** for speed and simplicity
- **MDX** for writing that can include code when needed
- **Minimal design** because the words should be the focus
- **Dark mode** because it's 2025 and light-only is hostile

## Looking Ahead

Next week will likely be about the actual work. The projects. The problems. For now, the system exists. That's enough.

One week at a time.
