A new year begins. Not with fireworks and champagne, but with a Monday morning and a fresh week.

## Looking Back

2025 was a year of building. Systems, habits, skills. Some stuck, many didn't. The ones that survived are the simple ones — the practices that asked for consistency rather than intensity.

This blog is one of those experiments. A weekly commitment to document, reflect, and share.

## Looking Forward

No grand resolutions. Just continuation:

- **Keep writing.** One week at a time.
- **Keep building.** Small, useful things.
- **Keep learning.** Stay curious.

## This Week

The transition week between years is always strange. Half the world is on vacation, half is pretending to work. I'm somewhere in between — using the quiet to think about what comes next.

The plan for 2026 is the same as 2025: do good work, document the process, and ship.

One week at a time.
