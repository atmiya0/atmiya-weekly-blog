Purpose of This Blog
Why I'm documenting my life by weeks.

This blog exists to document life one week at a time. I am fully confident that I will make it in life,
and this blog is the track record that proves the work, the consistency, and the progress behind that belief.
I have everything I need to make it through. Prayers, Guruhari, AVM teachers, good friends, and health that
allows me to work hard and stay focused. One week at a time, this is the story as it unfolds.

Here is the week that went by. I have been working on documentation to make the AVM Alumni Ravi Sabha more
efficient and organized. At the same time, preparation is underway on the content side for the upcoming
NY Ambrish Shibir happening in a week.

Job search is going on. Reworking on my portfolio and resume over the week.
