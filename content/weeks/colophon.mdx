This is the colophon—a detailed documentation of everything used to build this blog. Consider it a reference for future self and anyone curious about the technical decisions behind this space.

## Technology Stack

### Framework & Runtime

- **Next.js 16.1.1** — React framework with App Router for static site generation
- **React 19.2.3** — Latest React with the new React Compiler
- **TypeScript 5** — Strict type checking throughout the codebase

### Content Management

- **MDX** — Markdown with JSX support for writing posts
- **@mdx-js/loader & @mdx-js/react** — MDX processing and React integration
- **gray-matter** — YAML frontmatter parsing for post metadata
- **reading-time** — Automatic reading time calculation

### Styling

- **Tailwind CSS 4** — Utility-first CSS framework
- **@tailwindcss/postcss** — PostCSS integration for Tailwind

### Typography

- **Brunswick Grotesque** — Custom font loaded via `next/font/local`
- Regular weight only, no stylistic sets enabled
- 14px base size with 1.571em line height

### Development Tools

- **ESLint 9** with Next.js config — Code linting
- **Prettier 3** — Code formatting
- **babel-plugin-react-compiler** — React Compiler for automatic optimizations

## Design Decisions

### Layout

The blog uses a **two-column layout** on desktop:

- **Left column** (fixed): Profile information, stays in place while scrolling
- **Right column** (scrollable): Main content area

On mobile, the layout collapses to a single column with the header at the top.

### Colors

A minimal, two-tone palette:

- **Left sidebar**: `#FAFAFA` (warm off-white)
- **Right content**: `#FFFFFF` (pure white)
- **Text**: `#1C1917` (warm black)
- **Dividers**: `#E7E7E7` (light gray)

### Typography Philosophy

Single font, single weight, single size. The lack of visual hierarchy through typography forces clarity in writing. Structure comes from content, not from bold headings or varied sizes.

## File Structure

```
content/
  weeks/           # MDX blog posts
    week-01.mdx
    colophon.mdx
src/
  app/
    page.tsx       # Home page
    layout.tsx     # Root layout
    globals.css    # Global styles
    week/
      [slug]/
        page.tsx   # Individual post pages
  components/
    blog-layout.tsx    # Shared two-column layout
    countdown.tsx      # Countdown timer
    mdx-content.tsx    # MDX renderer
    week-navigation.tsx # Previous/next navigation
  lib/
    weeks.ts       # Post loading utilities
    dates.ts       # Date formatting helpers
  styles/
    typography.ts  # Font configuration
```

## Hosting & Deployment

- **Vercel** — Automatic deployments from GitHub
- **Domain**: blogs.atmiya.ca
- **Static export** — No server required at runtime

## What's Intentionally Not Here

- No analytics or tracking
- No comments system
- No newsletter signup
- No social share buttons
- No database or CMS
- No authentication
- No dark mode (yet)

The focus is on writing and reading. Everything else is noise.

## Dependencies Summary

**Production:**
- next, react, react-dom
- @mdx-js/loader, @mdx-js/react, @next/mdx
- date-fns, gray-matter, reading-time
- next-themes (for future dark mode)

**Development:**
- tailwindcss, @tailwindcss/postcss
- typescript, eslint, prettier
- Various type definitions

## Performance

Static generation means every page is pre-rendered at build time. No JavaScript required for the initial content render. The entire site is just HTML, CSS, and minimal JS for interactivity.
