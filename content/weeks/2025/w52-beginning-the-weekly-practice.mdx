This is a guide on how to write and publish blog posts on this weekly blog. Follow these guidelines to maintain consistency and quality.

## Getting Started

### File Location

All blog posts are stored in `content/weeks/` organized by year:

```
content/weeks/
├── 2025/
│   └── w52-your-post-slug.mdx
└── 2026/
    └── w01-your-post-slug.mdx
```

### File Naming Convention

**Format:** `w{week}-{slug}.mdx`

- `w` followed by the week number (2 digits preferred)
- Hyphen separator
- URL-friendly slug (lowercase, hyphens instead of spaces)

**Examples:**
- `w52-how-to-write-blogs.mdx`
- `w01-new-year-reflections.mdx`
- `w15-project-update.mdx`

## Frontmatter

Every blog post must start with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Blog Title"
week: 52
startDate: "2025-12-22"
endDate: "2025-12-28"
summary: "A brief description of your post."
slug: "your-blog-slug"
---
```

### Required Fields

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `title` | Display title of your post | `"Weekly Reflections"` |
| `startDate` | Monday of the week (YYYY-MM-DD) | `"2025-12-22"` |
| `endDate` | Sunday of the week (YYYY-MM-DD) | `"2025-12-28"` |
| `summary` | Brief description for SEO | `"What I learned this week."` |
| `slug` | URL-friendly identifier | `"weekly-reflections"` |
| `week` | Week number (for reference) | `52` |

### Date Rules

The system enforces strict date validation:

1. **startDate must be a Monday**
2. **endDate must be a Sunday**
3. **Duration must be exactly 6 days** (Monday to Sunday)

If dates are invalid, you'll see warnings in the terminal during development.

## Writing Content

### Markdown Basics

Use standard Markdown for content:

```markdown
## Section Heading

Regular paragraph text.

### Subsection

- Bullet point 1
- Bullet point 2

1. Numbered item
2. Another item

**Bold text** and *italic text*.

[Link text](https://example.com)
```

### Code Blocks

For code examples:

````markdown
```javascript
const greeting = "Hello, world!";
console.log(greeting);
```
````

### Images

Place images in `public/` and reference them:

```markdown
![Alt text](/your-image.png)
```

## Style Guidelines

### Writing Tone

- **Clear and direct** — No fluff
- **Personal but professional** — Write for yourself, but as if someone is reading
- **Honest** — Document failures as well as successes

### Structure

1. **Start with context** — What is this week about?
2. **Main content** — Details, learnings, progress
3. **Reflection** — What worked? What didn't?
4. **Looking ahead** — What's next?

### Length

- No strict limits, but aim for quality over quantity
- A few hundred words is perfectly fine
- Don't pad content unnecessarily

## Publishing

1. Create your `.mdx` file in the appropriate year folder
2. Ensure frontmatter is correct
3. Save the file
4. The site automatically rebuilds (in development) or on next deploy

## Tips

- **Write weekly** — Consistency matters more than perfection
- **Ship imperfect** — Better published than perfect in drafts
- **Be specific** — Details are what make posts valuable
- **Use headings** — Break up content for readability
- **Keep slugs short** — They appear in URLs
