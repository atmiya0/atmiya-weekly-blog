How to Write Blogs
2025-12-27
A guide on how to write and publish blog posts on this weekly blog.

This is a guide on how to write and publish blog posts on this weekly blog. Follow these guidelines to maintain consistency and quality.

## Getting Started

### File Location

All blog posts are stored in `content/weeks/` organized by year:

```
content/weeks/
├── _template.txt               # Template with checklist
├── 2025/
│   └── 2025-12-22-your-post-slug.txt
└── 2026/
    └── 2025-12-29-your-post-slug.txt
```

**Important:** Place files in the correct year folder based on the week's Monday date.

### File Naming Convention

**Format:** `YYYY-MM-DD-your-slug.txt`

**The date should be the Monday of your week.** The system will automatically:
- Normalize the date to the Monday of that ISO week
- Calculate the Sunday end date (6 days later)
- Validate dates in development mode

**Examples:**
- ✅ `2025-12-22-how-to-write-blogs.txt` (Dec 22, 2025 is a Monday)
- ✅ `2025-12-29-purpose-of-this-blog.txt` (Dec 29, 2025 is a Monday)
- ❌ `2025-12-25-christmas-post.txt` (Dec 25, 2025 is a Thursday - will be normalized to Dec 22)

**Note:** If you use a date that's not a Monday, the system will normalize it to the Monday of that week, but you'll see a warning in development mode.

## File Structure

Every blog post should have this structure:

**Line 1:** Your Title (required)  
**Line 2:** A brief summary (optional - auto-generated from content if empty)  
**Line 3+:** Your content (supports Markdown)

Example:

```
My Amazing Week
This week I learned a lot about writing and productivity.

Content starts here. Just write naturally in plain English.

You can use double newlines to create new paragraphs.

## You can use Markdown headings if you want

- Bullet points work
- Just like normal

**Bold text** and *italic text* also work if needed.

But you don't have to use any Markdown if you don't want to!
```

### What Happens Automatically

The system will:
1. Extract the date from the filename
2. Normalize it to the Monday of that ISO week
3. Calculate the Sunday end date (6 days after Monday)
4. Extract the slug from the filename (part after the date)
5. Generate a summary from content if Line 2 is empty
6. Calculate reading time
7. Validate dates in development mode (warns if not Monday-Sunday)

## Writing Content

### Keep It Simple

- Write in plain English
- Use double newlines to create new paragraphs
- No frontmatter or YAML needed (unless using .mdx files)
- No strict formatting rules

### Optional Markdown

If you want to use Markdown features, go ahead:

- `## Headings` for sections
- `**bold**` for emphasis
- `*italic*` for subtle emphasis
- `[links](https://example.com)` for external links
- `- bullet points` for lists
- `1. numbered lists` for sequences

But plain text works perfectly fine too!

## Style Guidelines

### Writing Tone

- **Clear and direct** — No fluff
- **Personal but professional** — Write for yourself, but as if someone is reading
- **Honest** — Document failures as well as successes

### Structure

1. **Start with context** — What is this week about?
2. **Main content** — Details, learnings, progress
3. **Reflection** — What worked? What didn't?
4. **Looking ahead** — What's next?

### Length

- No strict limits, but aim for quality over quantity
- A few hundred words is perfectly fine
- Don't pad content unnecessarily

## Publishing

### Quick Workflow

1. Run `npm run new-post "Your Title" "Your summary"` (recommended)
2. Open the generated file
3. Replace placeholder content with your actual writing
4. Use the pre-publish checklist from `_template.txt`
5. Save and commit

### Manual Workflow

1. Create your `.txt` file in `content/weeks/YYYY/` (use the correct year folder)
2. Name it `YYYY-MM-DD-your-slug.txt` where the date is a Monday
3. Write your title (Line 1), summary (Line 2), and content (Line 3+)
4. Save the file
5. Preview with `npm run dev`
6. Check for date validation warnings in console

### The Automation Way (Recommended)

Run this in your terminal:
```bash
npm run new-post "My Title" "My Summary"
```

This creates a file with:
- The correct date (next Monday after the latest post)
- Proper filename format
- Pre-filled template content
- Placed in the correct year folder

## Pre-Publish Checklist

Before publishing, verify:

- [ ] File is named correctly: `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.txt`
- [ ] Date in filename is a Monday
- [ ] File is in the correct year folder: `content/weeks/YYYY/`
- [ ] Line 1 has a clear, descriptive title
- [ ] Line 2 has a summary (or intentionally left blank)
- [ ] Content is written and complete
- [ ] No placeholder text remaining
- [ ] Ran `npm run dev` and previewed the post
- [ ] No console warnings about date validation

*(You can also find this checklist in `content/weeks/_template.txt`)*

## Tips

- **Write weekly** — Consistency matters more than perfection
- **Ship imperfect** — Better published than perfect in drafts
- **Be specific** — Details are what make posts valuable
- **Use headings** — Break up content for readability (or don't!)
- **Keep slugs short** — They appear in URLs
- **Check the template** — Reference `_template.txt` for formatting examples
- **Watch the console** — Development mode shows helpful warnings about dates

## Troubleshooting

### "Date validation failed" warning

This means your dates don't follow the Monday-Sunday rule:
- Ensure `startDate` (from filename) is a Monday
- The system auto-calculates the Sunday, but if you see this warning, check your filename date

### Post not showing up

- Make sure the file is in `content/weeks/YYYY/` (not just `content/weeks/`)
- File should end in `.txt` or `.mdx`
- File should not start with `_` (underscore)
- Restart dev server if needed
