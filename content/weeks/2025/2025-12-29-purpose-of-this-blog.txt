<p>This blog exists to document life one week at a time. I am fully confident that I will make it in life,<br />and this blog is the track record that proves the work, the consistency, and the progress behind that belief.<br />I have everything I need to make it through. Prayers, Guruhari, AVM teachers, good friends, and health that<br />allows me to work hard and stay focused. One week at a time, this is the story as it unfolds.</p><p>Here is the week that went by. I have been working on documentation to make the AVM Alumni Ravi Sabha more<br />efficient and organized. At the same time, preparation is underway on the content side for the upcoming<br />NY Ambrish Shibir happening in a week.</p><p>Job search is going on. Reworking on my portfolio and resume over the week.</p>
